@aemMultifield
Feature: aemMultifield

  Background:
    Given I am logged into AEM as admin

  Scenario: Multifield configuration works as expected
    Given I have opened Customer survey page
    And parsys I'm working with is named "par"
    And my component configuration data is:
      | tab            | type                    | label          | value            |
      | Title and Text | multifield#0#text field | Items#no label | multifield value |
    When I edit the "Radio Group" component
    And I removed all items from multifield
    Then multifield contains 0 elements
    When I added 1 item to multifield
    And I set the rest of the properties using my component configuration data
    Then component is configured according to configuration data

  Scenario: Multifield configuration for radio group
    Given I have opened Customer survey page
    And parsys I'm working with is named "par"
    And my component configuration data is:
      | tab            | type                    | label          | value            |
      | Title and Text | multifield#0#text field | Items#no label | multifield value |
    When I edit the Radio Group component
    And I removed all items from multifield
    Then multifield contains 0 elements
    When I added 1 item to multifield
    And I configure the properties in the dialog using my component configuration data
    Then Radio Group component has " multifield value" item
